- **Audio Format**: Standard audio formats (MP3 recommended)
- **Prompt**: Use the `prompt` parameter to control hand gestures for more natural and professional-looking videos
- **Resolution**: Choose between 720 or 1080 based on your needs - higher resolution may take longer to process
- **Resource Expiration**: Generated videos are valid for 7 days, save them promptly
- **Webhook**: Use `webhookUrl` to receive notifications when video generation is complete
- Save the `_id` from the response to check video status using the [Get Video Info Result](/ai-tools-suite/talking-photo/get-result) API
