## API Endpoints

### Face Swap Operations

- [Image Faceswap](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/image-faceswap) - Swap faces in images with high quality
- [V4 Image Faceswap (Simplified)](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/image-faceswap-v4) - Simplified face swap API for single face in images
- [Video Faceswap](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/video-faceswap) - Swap faces in videos with high quality

### Result Management

- [Get Faceswap Result List](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/get-result) - Retrieve faceswap results by IDs
- [Delete Faceswap Results](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/delete-result) - Delete faceswap results by IDs

### Account Management

- [Get User Credit Info](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/get-credit) - Get faceswap user credit information

### Utilities

- [Face Detect](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/face-detect) - Detect faces in images and get landmark information (required for v3 APIs)

## Getting Started

### Basic Workflow

1. **For V3 APIs (Image/Video Faceswap)**:
   - Use the [Face Detect API](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/face-detect) to detect faces and get landmark data
   - Use the `landmarks_str` value from the response as the `opts` parameter
   - Call the [Image Faceswap](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/image-faceswap) or [Video Faceswap](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/video-faceswap) API

2. **For V4 API (Simplified)**:
   - Directly call the [V4 Image Faceswap API](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/image-faceswap-v4) without face detection
   - Currently supports single face swapping only

3. **Check Results**:
   - Use the [Get Result API](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/get-result) to check the status of your face swap job
   - Download the result URL when the status is "Success" (status = 3)

### Response Code Description

<Note>
  Please note that if the value of the response code is not equal to 1000, the request
  has failed or encountered an error.
</Note>

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1000 | Success |
| 1003 | Parameter error or Parameter cannot be empty |
| 1005 | Operation is too frequent |
| 1006 | Your quota is not enough |
| 1007 | The number of people who can have their faces changed cannot exceed 8 |
| 1101 | Invalid authorization or The request token has expired |
| 1102 | Authorization cannot be empty |
| 1200 | The account has been banned |

## Face Swap Status Codes

When checking results, the `faceswap_status` field indicates the current state:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | In Queue - Your request is waiting to be processed |
| 2 | Processing - Face swap is currently being generated |
| 3 | Success - Face swap completed, result URL is available |
| 4 | Failed - Face swap failed, please check your input images |

## Best Practices

### Image Requirements

- **Quality**: Use high-resolution images for better results
- **Face Visibility**: Ensure faces are clearly visible and not obscured
- **Lighting**: Well-lit images produce better face swap results
- **Angle**: Frontal or slight angle faces work best

### Video Requirements

- **Duration**: Keep videos under 60 seconds for optimal processing time
- **Face Count**: For best results, limit to 8 or fewer faces
- **Resolution**: Higher resolution videos may take longer to process
- **Encoding**: Use standard encoding formats (H.264 recommended)

### API Usage Tips

- **Webhook**: Use the `webhookUrl` parameter to receive notifications when processing is complete
- **Face Enhancement**: Enable `face_enhance` for better quality results (may increase processing time)
- **Credit Management**: Check your credit balance regularly using the [Get Credit API](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/get-credit)
- **Result Cleanup**: Delete old results using the [Delete Result API](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/delete-result) to keep your account organized

## Common Use Cases

### Single Face Swap (Recommended for Beginners)

Use the [V4 Image Faceswap API](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/image-faceswap-v4) for the simplest implementation:

```json
{
  "targetImage": [
    {
      "path": "https://example.com/original.jpg"
    }
  ],
  "sourceImage": [
    {
      "path": "https://example.com/replacement-face.jpg"
    }
  ],
  "model_name": "akool_faceswap_image_hq",
  "face_enhance": false
}
```

### Multiple Face Swap

Use the [V3 Image Faceswap API](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/image-faceswap) for multiple faces:

1. Detect all faces using [Face Detect API](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/face-detect)
2. Provide the `opts` parameter for each face
3. Ensure source and target arrays are properly aligned

### Video Face Swap

Use the [Video Faceswap API](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/video-faceswap) for video content:

1. Detect faces in a representative frame
2. Provide face landmarks for both source and target
3. Monitor processing status as video face swaps take longer
