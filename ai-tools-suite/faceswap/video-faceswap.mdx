## Important Notes

- **sourceImage**: You need to change it to the link collection of the face you need. Pass your image through the [Face Detect API](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/face-detect) to obtain the link and key point data
- **targetImage**: Represents the collection of faces after face detection using modifyVideo. When the original video has multiple faces, here is the image link and key point data of each face
- When using [Face Detect API](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/face-detect), set `single_face: true` to return only the largest face data, or `false` to return all detected faces
- Ensure that each picture in the sourceImage is a single face, otherwise the face change may fail
- You need to ensure that sourceImage and targetImage correspond to each other in order
