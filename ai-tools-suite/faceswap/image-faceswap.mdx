## Important Notes

- You can get the `opts` parameter (landmarks_str) through the [Face Detect API](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/face-detect)
- The Face Detect API returns a `landmarks_str` value that should be used as the value of `opts`
- Ensure that the targetImage and sourceImage arrays are properly aligned and correspond to each other
