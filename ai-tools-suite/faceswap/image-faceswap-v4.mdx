## Face Swap Pro - More Realistic, More Similar

Face Swap Pro (V4 API) delivers superior face swap results with exceptional quality:

- **🎯 More Realistic**: Advanced algorithm produces incredibly natural and lifelike face swaps
- **✨ More Similar**: Enhanced matching technology ensures the swapped face closely resembles the target
- **🚀 Higher Accuracy**: Superior facial feature alignment for better results
- **⚡ Simplified Integration**: No need for the `opts` parameter or face detection step

## Important Notes

- **Single Face Limitation**: The 'akool_faceswap_image_hq' model **only supports single face** swapping in an image
- For images with **multiple faces**, use the [V3 Image Faceswap API](/ai-tools-suite/faceswap/image-faceswap)
- This simplified API does not require the `opts` parameter, making it easier to use compared to V3
- Face enhance must be a boolean value (true/false), default is false
- Best suited for high-quality portrait images with clear facial features
