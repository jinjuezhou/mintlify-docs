## Best Practices

### Image Requirements

- **Quality**: Use high-resolution images for better results
- **Face Visibility**: Ensure faces are clearly visible and not obscured
- **Lighting**: Well-lit images produce better talking photo results
- **Angle**: Frontal or slight angle faces work best

### Audio Requirements

- **Quality**: Use clear, high-quality audio files
- **Format**: Standard audio formats (MP3 recommended)
- **Duration**: Audio duration determines video length

### API Usage Tips

- **Webhook**: Use the `webhookUrl` parameter to receive notifications when processing is complete
- **Prompt**: Use the `prompt` parameter to control hand gestures for more natural-looking videos
- **Resolution**: Choose appropriate resolution (720 or 1080) based on your needs - higher resolution may take longer to process
- **Result Cleanup**: Save generated videos promptly as they expire after 7 days

## Common Use Cases

### Basic Talking Photo Video

Create a simple talking photo video from an image and audio:

```json
{
  "talking_photo_url": "https://example.com/photo.jpg",
  "audio_url": "https://example.com/audio.mp3",
  "resolution": "720",
  "webhookUrl": ""
}
```

### Talking Photo with Prompt

Use the `prompt` parameter to control hand gestures for professional presentations:

```json
{
  "talking_photo_url": "https://example.com/photo.jpg",
  "audio_url": "https://example.com/audio.mp3",
  "prompt": "Throughout the entire video, maintain natural and smooth hand movements. When speaking, use appropriate hand gestures to emphasize key points, such as opening your hands to express welcome or explanation, pointing your fingers forward to emphasize, and placing your hands together to summarize. The gestures should be coherent, not stiff, with moderate amplitude, and the frequency should be coordinated with the speaking speed. During pauses, the gestures naturally return to a relaxed state, presenting a professional and friendly presentation style.",
  "resolution": "1080",
  "webhookUrl": ""
}
```
