Both the avatar_id and voice_id can be easily obtained by copying them directly from the web interface. You can also create and manage your streaming avatars using our intuitive web platform.

**Knowledge Base Integration:** You can enhance your streaming avatar with contextual AI responses by integrating a [Knowledge Base](/ai-tools-suite/knowledge-base). When creating a session, provide a `knowledge_id` parameter to enable the AI to use documents and URLs from your knowledge base for more accurate and relevant responses.
