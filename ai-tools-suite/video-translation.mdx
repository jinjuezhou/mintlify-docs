## API Endpoints

### Translation Operations

- [Create Video Translation](/ai-tools-suite/video-translation/create-translation) - Translate videos into multiple languages with AI voices and lip-sync
- [Get Translation Result](/ai-tools-suite/video-translation/get-result) - Check processing status and retrieve translated video URLs

### Resource Management

- [Get AI Voices List](/ai-tools-suite/video-translation/get-voices) - Retrieve available AI voices for video translation
- [Get Language List](/ai-tools-suite/video-translation/get-languages) - Get supported languages for translation

## Getting Started

### Basic Workflow

1. **Get Available Languages**:
   - Use the [Get Language List API](/ai-tools-suite/video-translation/get-languages) to see all supported target languages
   - Note which languages require specific voice IDs

2. **Choose AI Voices (Optional)**:
   - Use the [Get AI Voices List API](/ai-tools-suite/video-translation/get-voices) to browse available voices
   - Filter by language code to find voices for your target language
   - Use voice previews to select the best voice for your content

3. **Create Translation**:
   - Call the [Create Video Translation API](/ai-tools-suite/video-translation/create-translation) with your video URL
   - Set `source_language` to "DEFAULT" for automatic language detection
   - Specify target languages and optional voice mappings
   - Configure additional options like lip-sync, captions, and background music removal

4. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Use the [Get Translation Result API](/ai-tools-suite/video-translation/get-result) to check processing status
   - Download the translated video URL when status reaches "Completed" (status = 3)

### Key Features

#### Automatic Language Detection
Set `source_language` to "DEFAULT" to automatically detect the original language of your video content.

#### Multiple Language Translation
Translate to multiple languages simultaneously by providing comma-separated language codes in the `language` parameter.

#### AI Voice Selection
Choose from a variety of AI voices for each target language to match your content's tone and style.

#### Lip-Sync Technology
Enable `lipsync` to synchronize mouth movements with the translated audio for more natural-looking results.

#### Caption Support
Add, translate, or replace subtitles with various caption handling options.

#### Advanced Translation Controls
Fine-tune translations with custom word mappings, pronunciation corrections, and translation styles.

## Best Practices

### Video Requirements

- **Duration**: Keep videos under 60 seconds for optimal processing time
- **Size**: Maximum file size is 300MB
- **Frame Rate**: Maximum 30fps supported
- **Audio**: Ensure your video contains clear audio for accurate translation
- **Encoding**: Use standard encoding formats (H.264 recommended)

### Translation Quality Tips

- **Clear Speech**: Videos with clear, well-articulated speech produce better translations
- **Background Noise**: Consider using `remove_bgm: true` to remove background music for clearer voice translation
- **Speaker Count**: Specify the correct number of speakers for better voice separation
- **Custom Voices**: Select appropriate AI voices that match your content's tone and target audience

### API Usage Tips

- **Webhook**: Use the `webhookUrl` parameter to receive notifications when processing is complete
- **Batch Processing**: For multiple videos, process them in parallel but monitor your quota usage
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper retry logic for failed translations
- **Result Management**: Download and save translated videos promptly as they expire after 7 days
