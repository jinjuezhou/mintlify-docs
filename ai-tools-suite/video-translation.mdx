## API Endpoints

### Translation Operations

- [Create Video Translation](/ai-tools-suite/video-translation/create-translation) - Translate videos into multiple languages and lip-sync
- [Get Translation Result](/ai-tools-suite/video-translation/get-result) - Check processing status and retrieve translated video URLs

### Resource Management
- [Get Language List](/ai-tools-suite/video-translation/get-languages) - Get supported languages for translation

## Getting Started

### Basic Workflow

1. **Get Available Languages**:
   - Use the [Get Language List API](/ai-tools-suite/video-translation/get-languages) to see all supported target languages
   - Note which languages require specific voice IDs

2. **Create Translation**:
   - Call the [Create Video Translation API](/ai-tools-suite/video-translation/create-translation) with your video URL
   - Set `source_language` to "DEFAULT" for automatic language detection
   - Specify target languages and optional voice mappings
   - Configure additional options like lip-sync, captions, and background music removal

3. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Use the [Get Translation Result API](/ai-tools-suite/video-translation/get-result) to check processing status
   - Download the translated video URL when status reaches "Completed" (status = 3)

### Key Features

#### Automatic Language Detection
Set `source_language` to "DEFAULT" to automatically detect the original language of your video content.

#### Multiple Language Translation
Translate to multiple languages simultaneously by providing comma-separated language codes in the `language` parameter.

#### Lip-Sync Technology
Enable `lipsync` to synchronize mouth movements with the translated audio for more natural-looking results.

#### Caption Support
Add, translate, or replace subtitles with various caption handling options.

#### Advanced Translation Controls
Fine-tune translations with custom word mappings, pronunciation corrections, and translation styles.

## Video Translation Status Codes

When checking results, the `video_status` field indicates the current processing state:

| 3 | Completed - Translation finished successfully, video URL is available |
| 4 | Failed - Translation failed, check error details for more information |

## Best Practices

### Video Requirements

- **Duration**: Keep videos under 60 seconds for optimal processing time
- **Size**: Maximum file size is 300MB
- **Frame Rate**: Maximum 30fps supported
- **Audio**: Ensure your video contains clear audio for accurate translation
- **Encoding**: Use standard encoding formats (H.264 recommended)

### Translation Quality Tips

- **Clear Speech**: Videos with clear, well-articulated speech produce better translations
- **Background Noise**: Consider using `remove_bgm: true` to remove background music for clearer voice translation
- **Speaker Count**: Specify the correct number of speakers for better voice separation

### API Usage Tips

- **Webhook**: Use the `webhookUrl` parameter to receive notifications when processing is complete
- **Batch Processing**: For multiple videos, process them in parallel but monitor your quota usage
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper retry logic for failed translations
- **Result Management**: Download and save translated videos promptly as they expire after 7 days

## Common Use Cases

### Single Language Translation

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/my-video.mp4",
  "source_language": "DEFAULT",
  "language": "es",
  "lipsync": true,
}
```

### Multi-Language Translation

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/my-video.mp4",
  "source_language": "DEFAULT",
  "language": "es,fr,de",
  "lipsync": false,
  "caption_type": 2,
  "remove_bgm": true
}
```

### Professional Translation with Advanced Controls

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/business-video.mp4",
  "source_language": "DEFAULT",
  "language": "zh-CN",
  "lipsync": true,
  "studio_voice": {
    "style": "professional",
    "no_translate_words": ["AKool", "API"],
    "fixed_words": {"hello": "您好"}
  },
  "caption_type": 3,
  "webhookUrl": "https://your-server.com/webhook"
}
