        "clone_prompt": "In late spring, the peony garden awakens with layers of petals of the Yao Huang and Wei Zi varieties. When the morning dew has not yet dried, the edges of the petals are glistening with crystal-like droplets, and the inner crimson, like silk, gradually deepens, as if the sunset had been cut into a dress. When the wind blows, the sea of flowers surges, and the golden stamens tremble, releasing a faint fragrance that lures bees and butterflies to swirl around the flower centers in golden vortices. The green peony, in particular, when it first blooms, has tips like jade carvings with a hint of moon white, and when it is in full bloom, it is like an ice wine in an emerald cup, making one suspect it is a divine creation from the Queen Mother's Jade Pool. Occasionally, a petal falls, becoming a rolling agate bead on the embroidered carpet, and even the soil is permeated with the elegant fragrance. Such a captivating beauty is why Liu Yuxi wrote that only the peony is truly the national color, and when it blooms, it moves the entire capital. It uses the entire season's brilliance to interpret the grandeur of being the queen of flowers.",
